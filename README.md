# Simple Webcrawler

This is the basic version of the web crawler where i have created a simple website inside the html folder. And which i ran by the live server. And then i tried to crawl all the webpages from that website. And then try to find the image in one of the webpages. Then it downloaded the image inside the images folder of the root directory.

## How to use

`
git clone https://github.com/SyedMuzamilM/webcrawler
`

Then create a directory `images` in the root folder and then run the script `npm run start`

If you want a bit dynamic webcrawler you can go to the `main` branch of this repository.
